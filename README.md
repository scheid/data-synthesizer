# Data Synthesizer

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.2.

The only purpose of this angular application is to develop the data-synthesizer angular library located in `projects/data-synthesizer`. That
is where you will find the source code for the data-synthesizer npm package.

To build the data synthesizer library, use: `ng build data-synthesizer`

The NPM package is located at [https://www.npmjs.com/package/data-synthesizer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/data-synthesizer)

If you are using React or VueJs, you can use the non-Angular version of the data synthesizer at https://www.npmjs.com/package/data-synthesizer-basic
